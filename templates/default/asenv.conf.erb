# Although the lines in this file are formatted as environment
# variable assignments, this file is NOT typically invoked as a script
# from another script to define these variables.  Rather, this file is read
# and processed by a server as it starts up.  That scanning code resolves
# the relative paths against the GlassFish installation directory.
#
# Yet, this file is also where users of earlier versions have sometimes added
# a definition of AS_JAVA to control which version of Java GlassFish
# should use.  As a result, in order to run a user-specified version of Java,
# the asadmin and appclient scripts do indeed invoke this file as a
# script - but ONLY to define AS_JAVA.  Any calling script should not
# rely on the other settings because the relative paths will be resolved
# against the current directory when the calling script is run, not the
# installation directory of GlassFish, and such resolution will not work
# correctly unless the script happens to be run from the GlassFish installation
# directory.
