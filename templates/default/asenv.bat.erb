rem # Although the lines in this file are formatted as environment
rem # variable assignments, this file is NOT typically invoked as a script
rem # from another script to define these variables.  Rather, this file is read
rem # and processed by a server as it starts up.  That scanning code resolves
rem # the relative paths against the GlassFish installation directory.
rem #
rem # Yet, this file is also where users of earlier versions have sometimes added
rem # a definition of AS_JAVA to control which version of Java GlassFish
rem # should use.  As a result, in order to run a user-specified version of Java,
rem # the asadmin and appclient scripts do indeed invoke this file as a
rem # script - but ONLY to define AS_JAVA.  Any calling script should not
rem # rely on the other settings because the relative paths will be resolved
rem # against the current directory when the calling script is run, not the
rem # installation directory of GlassFish, and such resolution will not work
rem # correctly unless the script happens to be run from the GlassFish installation
rem # directory.
